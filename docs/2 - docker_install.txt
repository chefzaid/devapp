Setting up a private Docker registry (often referred to as a private Docker Hub) on a private network involves using Docker's open-source registry solution. This allows you to host your Docker images internally without relying on Docker Hub. Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up a private Docker registry:

### Step 1: Install Docker

Make sure Docker is installed on the machine where you want to host the private registry. Follow the installation steps for your specific operating system, which were provided earlier in this guide.

### Step 2: Run the Docker Registry Container

Docker provides an official image for the registry. You can run it as a Docker container.

```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
```

This command pulls the official `registry` image from Docker Hub and runs it, mapping port 5000 on your host to port 5000 in the container.

### Step 3: Push Images to Your Private Registry

1. **Tag the Docker Image**: Tag your Docker image to point to your private registry. If your registry is running on `localhost`, use `localhost:5000` as the registry URL.

    ```sh
    docker tag your-image localhost:5000/your-image
    ```

2. **Push the Docker Image**: Push the tagged image to your private registry.

    ```sh
    docker push localhost:5000/your-image
    ```

### Step 4: Pull Images from Your Private Registry

1. **Pull the Docker Image**: You can pull the image from your private registry using the following command:

    ```sh
    docker pull localhost:5000/your-image
    ```

### Step 5: Configure Docker Clients to Use the Private Registry

If you are running the private registry on a remote server, replace `localhost` with the IP address or hostname of the server where the registry is running.

### Step 6: Setting Up Security

To make your private registry secure, you can configure it to use TLS and basic authentication.

#### 6.1 Generate Self-Signed Certificates

1. **Create a directory for certificates**:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p certs
    ```

2. **Generate the certificate and key**:

    ```sh
    openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout certs/domain.key -x509 -days 365 -out certs/domain.crt
    ```

#### 6.2 Run Registry with TLS

1. **Run the Docker Registry with TLS**:

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
      --restart=always \
      --name registry \
      -v $(pwd)/certs:/certs \
      -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \
      -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \
      registry:2
    ```

#### 6.3 Configure Docker to Trust the Certificate

1. **Copy the `domain.crt` file to Docker's certificate directory**:

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/localhost:5000
    sudo cp certs/domain.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/localhost:5000/ca.crt
    ```

2. **Restart Docker**:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

### Step 7: Configure Basic Authentication (Optional)

To add another layer of security, you can configure basic authentication.

1. **Create a directory for authentication files**:

    ```sh
    mkdir auth
    ```

2. **Generate the `htpasswd` file**:

    ```sh
    docker run --entrypoint htpasswd registry:2 -Bbn username password > auth/htpasswd
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Registry with TLS and Basic Authentication**:

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
      --restart=always \
      --name registry \
      -v $(pwd)/certs:/certs \
      -v $(pwd)/auth:/auth \
      -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \
      -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \
      -e REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd \
      -e REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM="Registry Realm" \
      -e REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd \
      registry:2
    ```

### Step 8: Jenkins Pipeline Integration

Update your Jenkins pipeline to authenticate with the private Docker registry.

**Jenkinsfile:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL = 'your-registry-url:5000'
        DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID = 'docker-registry-credentials'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build Spring Boot applications
                    sh 'mvn clean package -DskipTests'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build & Push') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def imageName = "${DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL}/your-image:${env.BUILD_ID}"
                    docker.build(imageName).push()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Ensure you have added Docker registry credentials in Jenkins:
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials > (Add credentials for Docker registry)

### Step 9: Kubernetes Deployment Manifests

Create Kubernetes deployment manifests to pull the Docker images from your private Docker registry.

**deployment.yaml Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app
        image: your-registry-url:5000/your-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Deploy to Kubernetes:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Summary

1. **Set up a private Docker registry** on a private network using Docker's registry image.
2. **Secure the registry** with TLS and optionally basic authentication.
3. **Integrate the registry with Jenkins** for CI/CD.
4. **Deploy Docker images from the private registry** to Kubernetes.

This setup ensures that you have a private, secure Docker registry for your organization, allowing you to manage and deploy Docker images internally.
