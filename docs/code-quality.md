# Code Quality

DevApp combines tests and coverage with backend/frontend Sonar analysis and
dependency reports. This guide covers manual scans, automatic analysis and the
contract to preserve when creating an application from this template. See the
[testing guide](testing.md) for test commands and
[ADR 0008](adr/0008-code-quality-and-verification.md#amendment-source-analysis-and-discovery-2026-09-08)
for the source-analysis decision and rationale.

Each repository owns its source paths, build commands, tests and scanner job.
The scheduled platform discovery below covers managed local application
namespaces, including `apps` and registered shared-cluster environments. It does not yet discover remote application clusters; those use
normal CI or manual scans. See the
[platform discovery scope](https://github.com/chefzaid/bm-cluster/blob/main/docs/observability.md#namespace-and-discovery).

## How It Runs

The platform's `infra/sonar-apps-discovery` CronJob runs every 15 minutes. It
follows Argo CD tracking annotations from managed local workloads to their source
repositories and deduplicates components from the same repository. DevApp's web,
user and order Deployments therefore share one Sonar project, `swirlit:devapp`.
Repositories must belong to the platform's configured GitLab hosts and group.

Discovery provisions missing Sonar projects, binds them to GitLab and supplies a
protected, masked project analysis token when `SONAR_TOKEN` is absent. Private
repositories receive private Sonar projects. Application code does not need a
Sonar administrator credential for its CI scan.

### Analysis Triggers

Manual scans remain available alongside automatic analysis:

| Trigger | When it runs |
|---|---|
| Manual scan | Start a default-branch pipeline with `SONAR_SCAN_ONLY=true` whenever a fresh analysis is needed. |
| Normal CI | Default-branch pipelines run `02-quality` automatically in both standard and full mode. |
| Discovery: first scan | The platform requests a scan when a discovered repository has no completed analysis. |
| Discovery: refresh | The platform requests another scan when the latest completed analysis is older than 24 hours. |

Discovery checks every 15 minutes. It requests at most one pipeline per run,
defers while an application pipeline is active and applies a six-hour retry
interval after an API-triggered attempt. The refresh threshold is therefore not
a promise of a scan at an exact time. A completed manual or normal CI analysis
also resets the age used by discovery.

Manual and discovery-triggered scan-only pipelines set `SONAR_SCAN_ONLY=true` and run
`01-build → 02-test → 02-quality`. Image packaging, E2E, Trivy, release, deployment
and repository version changes are excluded by job rules. SonarQube Community
Build analyzes the default branch (`main` here); other branches retain their
local test and dependency reports.

### Run A Manual Scan

1. Open GitLab **Build → Pipelines → Run pipeline** for the application.
2. Select the default branch (`main` in DevApp).
3. Add the pipeline variable `SONAR_SCAN_ONLY` with value `true`, then run the
   pipeline. Build, test and quality run automatically.
4. Check the `02-quality` log and the completed analysis in Sonar. You can also
   retry an existing default-branch `02-quality` job while its required test
   artifacts are still available.

Manual scans use the same source configuration, reports and credentials as
automatic scans. They do not require a new discovery run.

## Backend And Frontend Scope

[sonar-project.properties](../sonar-project.properties) includes both sides of
the application in the same analysis:

| Component | Source paths | Analysis inputs |
|---|---|---|
| Java backend and shared code | `devapp-common/src/main`, `user-app/src/main`, `order-app/src/main` | Compiled classes from all three modules, Maven dependency JARs and service JaCoCo XML reports |
| Angular frontend | `devapp-web/src` | TypeScript, HTML and CSS source, plus `devapp-web/coverage/devapp-web/lcov.info` |

The [test job](../.gitlab-ci.yml) publishes classes and coverage as artifacts;
`02-quality` downloads them through `needs`. Maven dependencies come from the CI
cache. [ci-quality.sh](../infra/scripts/ci-quality.sh) submits the analysis and
retains its task reference in `quality-reports/report-task.txt`.

Source/test filters determine which files are analyzed. Coverage exclusions
affect coverage metrics; they do not exclude those files from issue analysis.
Review both when adding modules or moving source directories.

## Adapting The Template

1. Update the repository URL, Application name and source path in
   [infra/argocd/application.yaml](../infra/argocd/application.yaml). Keep the
   Application in `infra` and the first-party workloads in `apps`. Let Argo CD
   manage the workloads and their tracking annotations so discovery can identify
   their source owner.
2. Set `sonar.projectKey` to the GitLab repository path with every `/` replaced
   by `:`: `swirlit/my-app` becomes `swirlit:my-app`. Update the display name,
   backend/frontend source and test paths, Java binaries/libraries and coverage
   paths in `sonar-project.properties`. When retaining the optional bootstrap
   scripts, also adapt their `APP_NAME`, `GITLAB_PROJECT_PATH` and
   `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` settings to the new application.
3. Keep [.sonar-auto.json](../.sonar-auto.json) on the default branch:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "job": "02-quality",
     "scanOnlyVariable": "SONAR_SCAN_ONLY"
   }
   ```

   If the quality job is renamed, update `job` to match. Preserve the contract
   version and variable name.
4. Adapt [.gitlab-ci.yml](../.gitlab-ci.yml) and the build/test helpers to the new
   stack. Preserve automatic default-branch quality analysis, its artifact
   dependencies and the scan-only rules on every publishing, deployment and
   version-changing job. Preserve scanner failure reporting in
   [ci-quality.sh](../infra/scripts/ci-quality.sh). Keep the default branch
   protected so its jobs can receive the protected `SONAR_TOKEN` variable.
5. Commit these files to the new repository's default branch, validate the CI
   configuration with both values of `SONAR_SCAN_ONLY`, and check a scan-only
   pipeline. Confirm that both backend and frontend files appear in the Sonar
   project's Code view and that the scanner imports the expected coverage
   reports. A green pipeline alone does not prove that both source trees were
   included.

No central application-name list needs updating. A new workload without an Argo
source mapping, a supported repository or the required CI contract produces a
visible discovery error. The controller cannot infer arbitrary build commands
or add the missing configuration to the application repository. Vendor software
in `corp`, such as Odoo, is outside this source-discovery scope.

## Verification And Troubleshooting

From the DevApp repository, verify the submission helper's success, scanner
failure and missing-token behavior without contacting live services:

```bash
bash infra/scripts/test-quality.sh
```

For platform-local workloads, inspect discovery with the central kubeconfig:

```bash
kubectl -n infra get cronjob sonar-apps-discovery
kubectl -n infra logs -l app=sonar-apps-discovery --prefix --tail=100
```

Look for the new repository and a summary with zero errors. An `analysis current`
message means no refresh is due. An active application pipeline or the retry
interval can defer a requested scan. To request analysis yourself, follow
[Run A Manual Scan](#run-a-manual-scan).

Inspect `02-quality` for missing credentials, missing binaries, unresolved source
paths or missing coverage reports. Scanner submission failures fail that job
visibly. `SONAR_REPORT_STATUS=submitted` means the report was uploaded; check
Sonar's completed analysis timestamp and quality gate separately. The job does
not wait for or enforce the quality gate, and its findings do not block release.

The platform's [source-analysis guide](https://github.com/chefzaid/bm-cluster/blob/main/docs/observability.md#source-analysis)
documents controller installation, credentials, permissions and tests. See also
the [deployment guide](deployment.md#automatic-sonar-coverage),
[ADR 0008](adr/0008-code-quality-and-verification.md) and the CI job contract in
[ADR 0009](adr/0009-explicit-delivery-jobs.md).
