# Deployment Guide

One shared `bm-cluster` platform provides GitLab, its runner and registry, Argo CD,
Vault, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka and Keycloak. DevApp's `int`, `uat` and `prod`
environments can run in separate namespaces on that same cluster or on optional
remote clusters. One GitLab project publishes images; central Argo CD deploys
the selected environment.

## Infrastructure Layout

| Directory or file | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `infra/k8s/` | Shared application manifests and public configuration templates. |
| `infra/overlays/ha/` | Optional application replica and disruption-budget profile. |
| `infra/environments/<env>/` | Generated environment settings, runtime ConfigMaps, ingress and image digests. |
| `infra/argocd/application.yaml` | Onboarding template; do not apply it to deploy an environment. |
| `infra/argocd/<env>.yaml` | Selected environment's central Argo CD Application and pinned source revision. |
| `infra/deployment-environments.json` | Public platform inventory copied during onboarding. |
| `infra/releases/<version>.json` | Published release identity and immutable component image digests. |
| `infra/snapshots/<pipeline-id>.json` | Snapshot provenance and digests on its dedicated integration delivery branch. |
| `infra/keycloak/` | Browser client template and disposable local realm. |
| `infra/compose/` | Local authenticated development stack. |
| `infra/scripts/` | Rendering, release and maintenance helpers. |

Application runtime resources stay in this repository. Cluster registration,
shared-service connectivity and platform credentials belong to `bm-cluster`.

## Ownership And Topology

Each environment has an Application named `devapp-<env>` in the central `infra`
namespace. It uses AppProject `applications-<env>` and the registered cluster and
namespace. Shared-cluster targets use destination `in-cluster` and namespaces
`apps-int`, `apps-uat` and `apps-prod` by default. An environment may instead use
its own registered remote cluster; local and remote targets can coexist. Remote
targets need distinct cluster registrations. All use the same GitLab, registry
and Argo CD installation.

Subdomains route to separate Deployments; they do not create isolation by
themselves. Environment namespaces have their own Secrets and platform-managed
access controls, network policies and resource limits. Shared-cluster environments
also share capacity, outages and cluster maintenance. Existing workloads in
`apps` remain there until an explicit migration; local environments cannot reuse
that legacy namespace.

The central `infra/deployment-environments` ConfigMap supplies the authoritative
cluster and shared-service endpoints. The registrar publishes this checkpoint
only after verifying Argo CD registration, target identity and prerequisites;
CI reads that public record without access to cluster credentials. Rerun platform
registration after credential or target maintenance. For a newly registered
environment, rerun application onboarding to prepare its data, identity and DNS;
then select it without changing application source. Reassigning an existing environment
to another cluster or namespace requires an explicit migration.

Each environment has separate database credentials/database, Redis cache prefix
and credentials, Kafka topic prefix and credentials, and browser client
`devapp-<env>-web`. Runtime credentials come from Vault paths
`apps/devapp/<env>/{database,redis,kafka}`. The registry credential at
`apps/devapp/registry` is shared read access to this project's images. The
registered `secretStoreName` selects each environment's scoped Vault store.
Shared-cluster workloads use Kubernetes Service endpoints; remote workloads use
the platform's private gateway. Registration supplies these endpoint choices,
connectivity and secret access before deployment.

## Kubernetes Desired State

The shared base contains the user, order and web Deployments and Services,
ingress, observability resources, ExternalSecrets and generated ConfigMaps.
Remote deployments also include the application's ingress NetworkPolicy; local
deployments use platform-owned network policies that application CI cannot relax.
The workloads use non-root containers, read-only root filesystems, explicit
resources, health probes and restricted Linux capabilities.
Argo CD creates application and health ingress routes after the workloads become
healthy. Moving an existing hostname between namespaces still needs an explicit
route cutover so two environments never compete for the same hostname.

Environment overlays replace public runtime configuration and select images by
digest. They contain no copied Java, Angular or Kubernetes base source. ConfigMap
content hashes roll the affected Deployments when settings change. The generated
Application pins an exact Git revision, so changing the shared base or deploying
another environment does not move an existing environment's desired state.

Render without changing a cluster:

```sh
kubectl kustomize infra/k8s >/dev/null
kubectl kustomize infra/overlays/ha >/dev/null
# After onboarding/deployment generated the selected environment:
kubectl kustomize infra/environments/int >/dev/null
```

## Images

The release publishes three images in the central project registry:

```text
<registry>/<gitlab-project-path>/user-app:<semantic-version>
<registry>/<gitlab-project-path>/order-app:<semantic-version>
<registry>/<gitlab-project-path>/devapp-web:<semantic-version>
```

Each image is built once during publication. The release manifest records its
`sha256` digest, publishing pipeline and source revision; deployment uses those
digests. Environment promotion reuses the published images and does not rebuild
Java, Angular or containers. Public settings load at runtime, so the same web
image works with every environment hostname and browser client.

Integration snapshots use `snapshot-<source-commit>-<pipeline-id>` image tags and
also deploy by digest. They are not GitLab releases and cannot deploy to `uat`
or `prod`; a source version ending in `-SNAPSHOT` is supported for integration.

## Add or reconfigure this repository

Run the platform's `./add-repos.sh` and select DevApp. Its
[onboarding declaration](../infra/onboarding.json) supplies the app contract;
the platform imports this repository once and prepares its registered environment
settings. The initial deployment defaults to `int`; set
`ONBOARDING_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` explicitly to select another registered target.

Public choices are stored in `infra/environments/<env>/settings.json`:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `appSubdomain` | The shared onboarding app label, default `devapp`; `@` selects each environment's domain apex. |
| `trustedProxyCIDRs` | Trusted ingress addresses for API rate limiting; first setup uses the target pod CIDR. |
| `highAvailability` | Enables the [HA profile](#future-multi-node-ha-profile) on a prepared application cluster. |
| `databaseName` | Defaults to `devapp_<env>`; production alone can explicitly retain legacy `devappdb` after the ownership/credential migration below. |

The shared platform supplies registry/project paths, service endpoints and the
Keycloak realm. Environment registration supplies its domain and TLS policy,
namespace, hostname style and destination. The `suffix` style produces
`devapp-int.example.com`, `devapp-uat.example.com` and `devapp.example.com`, covered
by the parent zone wildcard. The optional `nested` style retains
`devapp.int.example.com` and `devapp.uat.example.com` when deeper TLS coverage is
available.
Onboarding applies one app label across all registered environments; proxy CIDRs
and HA selection remain specific to each environment.

Angular validates `/runtime-config.json` before authentication starts. Backend
settings come from `backend-runtime.properties`; credentials come from the
`devapp-runtime-credentials` ExternalSecret. Central provisioning creates each
environment's database and restricted user before delivery; application pods do
not receive the PostgreSQL administrator credential or run a database-creation
hook. Flyway owns schema migrations inside that environment's database.

For an existing production `devappdb`, first migrate its owner and schema objects
to the restricted `devapp_prod` role and preserve its credentials at
`apps/devapp/prod/database` in Vault. Set `databaseName` to `devappdb` in production
settings before onboarding. Central provisioning verifies this explicit adoption;
it never transfers ownership or selects a different database silently. Other
environments cannot select that database.

Onboarding commits public configuration and starts an API pipeline for that exact
source commit. Its release job is automatic only for an explicit onboarding
request or a full-mode web pipeline. Sonar-only pipelines cannot deploy. The
final deployment pointer carries pipeline/source trailers so an interrupted
onboarding run can verify and resume its own work.

## Delivery Flow

Open **Build → Pipelines → New pipeline**, then choose `PIPELINE_MODE=full`:

| Target | Branch / version selection | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `int` | Any branch; leave `RELEASE_VERSION` empty. | Build and deploy an immutable snapshot. |
| `int`, `uat` or `prod` | Default branch; set `RELEASE_VERSION`, such as `1.2.3`. | Deploy that finalized release without rebuilding. |
| `uat` or `prod` | Default branch; leave `RELEASE_VERSION` empty. | Publish a stable release, then deploy it after GitLab finalizes it. |

All branch snapshots share the `int` environment and hostname; a newer deployment
replaces the previous integration deployment. This does not create a hostname per
branch. Feature branches need the current CI helpers, so merge or rebase older
branches once when adopting this delivery flow. A branch with an open merge
request can still start an explicit web deployment pipeline.

Release promotion skips build, test, scan, publication and version-change jobs.
Deployment verifies the annotated release tag, GitLab release and image digests.
Snapshots and unfinished releases are rejected for `uat` and `prod`.

Ordinary pipelines build automatically and leave publication manual. Optional E2E,
quality and security reports do not gate release. Compilation/package artifacts
are produced by `01-build`; `01-release` builds and publishes the containers once.
`01-snapshot` publishes integration containers. `02-deploy` depends on the
appropriate successful publication unless promoting an existing release.

Publication and major-version changes share a project-wide lock. Deployments use
one lock per environment and normal Git pushes; a concurrent change to the shared
branch makes a stale deployment stop instead of overwriting it. Start a new
promotion pipeline from the latest default branch after reviewing that change.

Release deployment commits the selected environment overlay, then a separate Application
pointer to that exact runtime commit. Both commits are pushed before CI applies
only the selected central Application. CI verifies its destination, source path,
pinned revision, three image digests, `Synced`/`Healthy` status and Deployment
health. Public checks verify the SPA, exact runtime identity configuration and
both API health routes. These checks use the selected public hostname for both
shared-cluster and remote environments.

Snapshot deployment writes its runtime configuration and Application pointer to
`gitops/int/<pipeline-id>`, based on the selected source commit. It reads current
public target settings from the default branch and leaves the source branch,
default branch, version baseline and other environment pointers unchanged. The
Application pins the generated runtime commit. Retrying a published snapshot
reuses its recorded digests; a stale pipeline cannot replace a newer integration
deployment.

Onboarding gives DevApp dedicated project runners. Branch jobs can update only
the integration Application; a protected runner handles release delivery.
Kubernetes admission checks keep each Application bound to its assigned project,
repository and target. Shared instance runners are disabled for this project;
other applications keep their existing runner configuration.

## Version Lifecycle

[`VERSION`](../VERSION) establishes the `major.minor.patch` baseline. Builds add
one patch step for each first-parent commit since that baseline. Publication tags
the computed version, records the immutable image manifest and prepares the next
minor baseline with patch zero. Releasing `1.0.3`, for example, prepares `1.1.0`.
Promotion and integration snapshots do not change the baseline or create another
release tag. Initial API onboarding retains its stable release-and-deploy flow.

For a deliberate major change, set `NEW_MAJOR_VERSION` when starting a normal
pipeline and run `set-major-version` on the default branch. It updates Maven and
npm versions together and refuses a stale branch.

## Verification And Rollback

Inspect the selected Application through the central Kubernetes context:

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig /secure/platform.yaml -n infra get application devapp-int -o json | jq '{source:.spec.source,destination:.spec.destination,status:.status}'
curl --fail https://devapp-int.example.com/runtime-config.json
curl --fail https://devapp-int.example.com/health/user
curl --fail https://devapp-int.example.com/health/order
```

The health routes expose only application health; actuator metrics are not
published by those routes. Inspect Pods and ExternalSecrets in the selected
namespace: use the platform kubeconfig for local targets and the registered
target's kubeconfig for remote targets.

If GitLab release registration fails after publication, retry that pipeline's
release job. It verifies its tag, source/pipeline receipts and image manifest,
then completes registration without rebuilding or republishing. A failed deploy
job can retry its own committed pointer without adding another deployment commit.
An unrelated branch change requires a new pipeline. Credentials and already
published configuration are retained; there is no automatic data rollback.

To roll back images, run a promotion pipeline with the previous release version
and selected environment. Current public settings remain in effect. Restoring
older configuration also requires reviewing that environment's prior settings
and Application pin. Database migrations must remain compatible with the selected
application version; image rollback does not undo database changes.

## Local Checks

```sh
python3 infra/scripts/test-onboarding.py
python3 infra/scripts/test-release.py
python3 infra/scripts/test-deployment.py
```

These checks need Python with PyYAML, Git, Bash, jq and kubectl. They use disposable
Git repositories and fake APIs to verify publication recovery, routing, target
ownership, independent pins, digest promotion and wrong-target refusal. Set
`BM_CLUSTER_SOURCE=/path/to/bm-cluster` for the actual onboarding renderer checks.
No live deployment is needed.

## Production Identity

The platform owns the realm and its users. Each environment's public browser
client uses Authorization Code with PKCE `S256`, restricts redirects and origins
to its own hostname, and disables password and implicit grants. Its identifier
also supplies the API's expected JWT audience. Onboarding manages these clients
centrally; never import the disposable Compose realm into the shared identity
service. Removing workloads does not remove credentials, data or clients;
retire only the intended environment's resources after verifying ownership.

## Public DNS

Follow [application DNS ownership](dns.md). Onboarding targets each environment's
registered ingress address. Shared-cluster environments use the same address
with different hostnames. DNS changes do not select the Argo CD target.

## Local And Manual Paths

The authenticated local stack remains available through Compose:

```sh
docker compose -f infra/compose/compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Use the GitLab environment selector for deployed environments. The onboarding
Application template is rendered into a selected, pinned Application before use.

## Automatic Sonar coverage

One Sonar project covers both APIs, their shared Java module and Angular.
`sonar-project.properties` owns source/coverage inputs; `.sonar-auto.json` declares
scan-only behavior. The [code-quality guide](code-quality.md) covers credentials,
schedules, troubleshooting and adaptation to another application.

## Future multi-node HA profile

`infra/overlays/ha` runs two copies of each API and frontend, spreads Pods across
hostnames and adds disruption budgets. Enable `highAvailability` in the selected
environment's settings only after at least two eligible hosts and their ingress
routing are ready. Other environments keep their own profile. The overlay
inherits the selected digest and generated runtime configuration.

Shared services must also remain available: PostgreSQL needs a replicated primary,
Redis needs failover, Kafka needs replicated brokers/topics, and Keycloak and
network routing must survive the tested failure. Application replicas do not
provide those guarantees. Flyway migrations must support rolling deployments;
rate limits remain per API process. Database commits and Kafka publication remain
separate operations, so replicas do not solve the missing transactional outbox.

Before relying on HA, verify JWT requests across replicas, cache invalidation,
Kafka rebalance and duplicate handling, then drain one eligible application node
while exercising both APIs. A disruption budget governs voluntary eviction; it
cannot prevent hardware failures.
