# Features

This guide catalogs capabilities already represented in DevApp. Planned work belongs in [TODO.md](../TODO.md), so this file distinguishes implemented behavior from future intent.

DevApp is a technical template. Its user directory and order flow are intentionally small: they exist to exercise reusable full-stack and distributed-system patterns, not to grow into a product domain.

## Minimal Demonstration Flow

The application has only two business concepts:

1. `user-app` creates, retrieves, edits, and deletes users.
2. `order-app` creates a `PENDING` order and publishes an event.
3. `user-app` resolves the referenced user and publishes an `APPROVED` or `REJECTED` result.
4. `order-app` validates the result and updates the order.
5. The Angular UI shows both resources and can create, edit, or delete each one.

This flow proves HTTP APIs, persistence, caching, asynchronous communication, authentication, UI integration, tests, observability, and delivery without requiring a large functional model.

## Backend Architecture

Implemented backend structure:

- Maven reactor with `devapp-common`, `user-app`, and `order-app`
- independent Spring Boot processes and deployable images for the two services
- conventional controller, service, repository, domain, DTO, and configuration layers
- shared library for entity auditing, status/event contracts, error handling, request IDs, rate limiting, and Kafka reliability
- Java 25 virtual threads
- graceful Spring shutdown
- profile-specific local and production behavior
- package and compiler configuration that retains method parameter names for validation errors

The services do not call one another synchronously. Kafka is the service boundary for the order-validation workflow.

## REST API And Contracts

Implemented API behavior:

- `GET /api/users` and `GET /api/orders` with a bounded `limit` query parameter (`1..100`, default `100`)
- `GET /api/users/{id}` and `GET /api/orders/{id}` with positive identifier validation
- `POST /api/users` and `POST /api/orders` with Jakarta Bean Validation
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` and `PUT /api/orders/{id}` for full resource edits
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` and `DELETE /api/orders/{id}` with `204 No Content` responses
- `201 Created` responses and `Location` headers for created resources
- explicit request and response DTOs instead of serializing JPA entities
- response DTOs that hide audit principals and optimistic-lock versions
- username and email normalization before persistence
- fail-fast username and email conflict checks backed by database uniqueness constraints
- conflict checks that exclude the user currently being edited
- RFC 9457-style Spring `ProblemDetail` responses for validation, malformed input, missing resources, conflicts, unsupported methods/media types, and unexpected failures
- structured field and parameter violation maps
- generated or accepted safe `X-Request-Id` values on every response
- request IDs in error bodies and production logging context
- configurable per-principal or per-IP fixed-window rate limiting
- `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset`, and `Retry-After` response headers
- SpringDoc OpenAPI documents for each service and one aggregated Swagger UI
- explicit CORS origins, methods, request headers, and exposed response headers
- HTTP compression and forwarded-header support

The APIs demonstrate Richardson Maturity Model level 2 resource and HTTP semantics. They do not claim level 3 because no HATEOAS controls are emitted.

## Transactions, Persistence, And Auditing

Implemented data behavior:

- Spring Data JPA repositories
- `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` query boundaries
- `@Transactional` write and event-result boundaries
- PostgreSQL 18 for production-shaped environments
- Flyway migrations in production and UAT
- separate Flyway history tables for both services when sharing one PostgreSQL schema
- Hibernate schema validation instead of production schema mutation
- H2 databases, schema SQL, and deterministic seed data for the dependency-free development profile
- optimistic locking through a shared JPA `@Version` field
- JPA auditing with created/modified principals and timestamps
- authenticated principal resolution with a `system` fallback for non-authenticated work
- sorted, bounded collection queries
- custom database health indicators

See [Data Model](./data-model.md) for columns, ownership, and migration rules.

## Caching

Implemented caching behavior:

- Spring Cache annotations on single-resource reads
- cache eviction after creates and event-driven order updates
- simple in-memory caches in the default development profile
- Redis-backed caches in UAT and production
- JSON value serialization and string keys
- ten-minute Redis TTLs
- separate `users` and `orders` cache regions
- Redis health contribution in production

The current cache is an acceleration layer, not a source of truth. Distributed stampede controls and explicit degraded-mode behavior remain roadmap work.

## Event-Driven Processing

Implemented Kafka behavior:

- immutable `OrderEvent` records shared by producer and consumers
- keyed order and result records so events for one order retain partition ordering
- three-partition order and result topics
- matching dead-letter topics
- declarative topic creation when messaging is enabled
- feature switch through `app.messaging.enabled` / `KAFKA_ENABLED`
- producers configured with `acks=all`, idempotence, bounded delivery time, and retries
- producer request and delivery timeouts validated together against Kafka client defaults
- record-level listener acknowledgement
- four consumer attempts by default with fixed retry delay
- dead-letter publishing after retry exhaustion
- non-retryable classification for invalid event contracts or state
- synchronous result publication before the source record is acknowledged
- rejection only for the business case where a referenced user does not exist
- propagation of transient processing failures for retry instead of turning them into false business rejections
- order-result identity and status validation
- idempotent handling of duplicate final results
- edited orders return to `PENDING` and publish a fresh validation request
- order validation requests are published after the database transaction commits
- late results for superseded edits or deleted orders are ignored safely
- rejection of invalid order state transitions
- local single-node Kafka 4.3 in KRaft mode

The initial order insert and Kafka publish are not atomic. A transactional outbox is intentionally listed in [TODO.md](../TODO.md) rather than hidden behind an unsafe in-process retry.

## Authentication And Security

Implemented security behavior:

- Keycloak realm configuration for the disposable demo
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow with PKCE (`S256`)
- public Angular client without a browser-held client secret
- disabled Resource Owner Password Credentials flow
- access tokens attached by an Angular HTTP interceptor
- protected Angular routes with authentication readiness handling
- Spring Security OAuth2 resource servers validating JWTs
- stateless backend session policy
- all application APIs authenticated in UAT and production
- health, metrics, and API documentation allowlists
- authentication disabled in the default local profile for a fast developer loop
- production H2 console disabled and not security-allowlisted
- CSRF disabled for stateless bearer-token APIs
- narrow CORS configuration
- HTTPS redirect and TLS termination at NGINX Ingress
- default Spring security headers, with frame embedding relaxed only for the local H2 console
- public ingress removed for Actuator; Prometheus scrapes cluster services through NetworkPolicy
- Kubernetes containers run as non-root with a read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, and runtime-default seccomp
- disabled service-account token mounting for application pods
- database and registry credentials supplied through Vault, External Secrets, and Kubernetes secrets

Passwords do not enter the application databases. Keycloak owns password hashing and credential policy. See [Security](./security.md) for trust boundaries and known limitations.

## Angular Application

Implemented frontend behavior:

- Angular 22 standalone application
- lazy-loaded login, users, and orders routes
- functional route guard and HTTP interceptor
- OAuth discovery, login, logout, token refresh setup, and auth-state observables
- RxJS service layer for API calls and notifications
- typed user and order models
- create, list, edit, and confirmed-delete views for the two demonstration resources
- visible API error handling and notification surface
- `OnPush` change detection
- semantic navigation and form labels used by browser tests
- development proxy for both APIs and Keycloak
- production, UAT, and development environment configurations
- production build served by unprivileged NGINX
- SPA fallback, compression, immutable static-asset caching, and basic browser security headers

The UI deliberately stays small. It is a vehicle for authentication, API integration, test, build, and deployment patterns.

## Observability

Implemented observability behavior:

- Spring Boot Actuator health, info, metrics, and Prometheus endpoints
- liveness, readiness, and startup probe groups
- custom database health indicators with record counts
- Micrometer Prometheus registry
- pod scrape annotations and NetworkPolicy access for Prometheus
- provisioned Grafana dashboard for target health, request rate, 5xx rate, response time, JVM heap, CPU, database connections, pod memory, and restarts
- readable development logs
- structured JSON stdout logs in UAT and production
- application name, level, logger, thread, message, arguments, MDC, and stack trace fields
- request-ID correlation through MDC
- provisioned Kibana data view, saved search, and log dashboard
- post-deployment backend and frontend smoke checks

Distributed traces, SLO alerts, and event-specific metrics are future reusable capabilities.

## Testing And Quality Reporting

Implemented verification layers:

- JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, Spring MVC Test, and Spring Security Test
- focused controller, service, cache, filter, health-indicator, listener, and security tests
- anonymous-versus-JWT integration tests using full Spring Security contexts
- event success, duplicate, invalid-state, missing-resource, retryable-failure, and rejection scenarios
- JaCoCo reports and a non-blocking 80 percent combined line-coverage policy
- Vitest component, service, guard, interceptor, and authentication tests
- frontend V8 coverage and JUnit-compatible CI output
- Playwright browser tests for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- mocked local UI journeys and live Keycloak/API acceptance
- containerized full-stack acceptance through `infra/compose/compose.test.yaml`
- production Angular build and Playwright TypeScript checks in GitLab CI
- immutable JAR archiving after successful builds

See [Testing](./testing.md) for commands, test maps, and where each layer should be used.

## Local Development And Packaging

Implemented developer and packaging support:

- dependency-free default backend profile using H2, simple cache, disabled Kafka listeners, and disabled authentication
- complete Docker Compose environment with application images and all runtime dependencies
- Compose health checks and dependency ordering
- VS Code dev container with Java 25, Maven 3.9, Node 24, npm 12, and Angular CLI 22
- optional dev-container infrastructure profile
- Mask task commands for install, test, coverage, build, and component startup
- multi-stage source-build Dockerfiles
- runtime Dockerfiles that package already-verified CI artifacts
- fixed non-root container users and minimal runtime images
- full-stack Playwright test runner image

## Kubernetes And Delivery

Implemented platform features:

- Kustomize-managed user, order, web, ingress, secret, network, and observability resources
- ClusterIP services and path-based NGINX Ingress routing
- TLS-only public ingress
- startup, liveness, and readiness probes
- requests and limits for application and CI containers
- restrictive application pod security contexts
- ingress NetworkPolicy for application pods, NGINX, Prometheus, and GitLab CI smoke tests
- Vault-backed database and CI credentials through External Secrets
- persistent Maven/npm dependency caches and private GitLab image registry integration
- explicit GitLab jobs for build, optional tests, Docker validation, optional E2E/quality reports, release, deploy, and set-major-version
- persistent Maven, npm, and Sonar analyzer caches plus 30-day registry-backed Kaniko layer caches
- daemonless Kaniko image publication with immutable semantic-version tags
- seven-day JUnit, Cobertura, Playwright, and verified-build artifacts plus immutable JAR/SPA archives in GitLab's Generic Package Registry
- GitLab Releases, production Environment deployment history, enterprise project metadata, labels, templates, protected branches, and quality badges
- semantic release/GitOps commit plus an automatically prepared next-minor version
- Argo CD refresh, exact-revision wait, self-healing, and pruning
- post-rollout service smoke tests and real browser acceptance
- optional Ansible Kustomize apply helper and one-time CI/CD configuration script
- push-triggered, bidirectional GitHub/GitLab reconciliation for branches and tags without force pushing

GitLab is the CI/CD source of truth; GitHub is the public mirror.

## Current Technical Boundaries

Do not present these as implemented:

- transactional outbox or atomic database/event publication
- durable consumer inbox/deduplication store
- distributed or edge-global rate limiting
- method-level roles or business authorization policies
- application-level field encryption or KMS integration
- synchronous HTTP resilience patterns such as circuit breakers or bulkheads
- general-purpose `@Async` jobs or scheduled cleanup
- service mesh, saga, or API gateway owned by this repository
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- Testcontainers, contract tests, mutation tests, load tests, or chaos tests
- HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, canary rollout, or environment overlays
- automated SBOM signing, SAST, DAST, or policy-as-code gates

These are tracked as technically focused candidates in [TODO.md](../TODO.md).
