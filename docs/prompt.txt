Create a simple set of microservices with the following requirements:

- Based on Java / Spring Boot
- It has an Angular frontend that uses the said backend
- The backend is exposed through REST APIs with Swagger
- The application is Dockerized and uses Kubernetes
- The microservices do basic CRUD operation on a Postgres database
- Microservices communicate through Kafka
- Logging is done using ELK stack with ElasticSearch and Logstash and a Kibana dashboard
- Monitoring is done through Prometheus and Grafana
- The delivery pipelines are automated through Jenkins

Optionally, add:
- A Redis store is used for caching
- Authentication is managed by Okta
- Set up Kubernetes and Docker (with private registry)
- Tools (Gitlab, JIRA, Confluence, Nexus/Artifactory)

Give me a step by step guide to create all of this and how to glue them together with code snippets and all the necessary configuration to achieve this (even the configuration of maven)
